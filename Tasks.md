| UML class diagrams                        |   20%   | 80%  | Mate will be responsible for creating the UML class diagrams, while I will collaborate during the planning process.                                                               |
| GUI design and implementation             |   80%   | 20%  | I will handle most of the GUI design and implementation, ensuring compliance with the Avalonia framework. Mate will assist me with any necessary support or code review as well as the initial planning.            |
| Controller implementation                 |   50%   | 50%  | Mate and I will share the responsibility for implementing the controller functionality, working together to ensure the required functionalities are implemented correctly.       |
| Sequence diagrams                         |   30%   | 70%  | Mate will primarily work on the sequence diagrams, while I will contribute and collaborate with Mate to ensure accuracy and completeness.                                           |
| Networking: fetching data from https://www.weatherapi.com/ (Or others if necessary) |   70%   | 30%  | I will handle the majority of the implementation for fetching data from the https://www.weatherapi.com/ API. Mate will provide support and assistance, particularly with error handling and authentication. |
| Parallelization of computation tasks       |   80%   | 20%  | I will be responsible for implementing and optimizing the parallelization of computation tasks. Mate will provide assistance and collaborate with me on the design and testing.    |
| Data storage component                     |   40%   | 60%  | Mate will take the lead in programming the initial design of the data storage component, while I will refine and contribute as necessary the implementation as necessary.                          |
| Computation component                      |   50%   | 50%  | Mate and I will share the responsibility for implementation of the computation component, leveraging parallelization techniques and ensuring efficient processing.       |
| Documentation and project coordination     |   50%   | 50%  | Mate and I will share the responsibility for documentation, including the README.md file and any other necessary project documentation. We will also coordinate project milestones. |

This is just initial idea brain storming, awaiting yes from all
